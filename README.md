# Dotfiles!

A very comfy setup using Niri or GNOME

## Installation:

You will need git and bash on either Arch Linux (with AUR) or NixOS

1. Clone the repo at ~/Projects/dotfiles/
2. Run `./scripts/install` with the appropriate flags, use `-h` to list them

## What It Has
- Link the configuration files to the correct places
- Zsh with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- Oh my posh custom prompt
- Niri + DankMaterialShell
- A full Neovim setup
- Way too many hours sunk into this
